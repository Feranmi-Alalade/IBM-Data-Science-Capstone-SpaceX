# IBM-Data-Science-Applied-Capstone-Project-SpaceX
In this project, we predicted the landing outcome of the Falcon 9 first stage using Data Science methodology and Machine Learning algorithms.
SpaceX rocket launches costs about 65 million dollars while other providers cost about 165 million upwards. This is because SpaceX reuses its first stage,
which is also called the booster stage. The booster returns to the earth surface landing on either ground pads, ocean ships or Drone ships. 
This project is based on previous launch data (the landing outcomes of the boosters of previous launches), and algorithm predicts the landing outcomes
of future launches
# Business-Understanding
This project helps in determining the cost of a launch and to prepare for unseen circumstances.
# Performance-measures
The performance evaluation measures of the algorithms is Accuracy.
# Deliverables
. A presentation of the findings during the project
. An accurate predictive algorithm
